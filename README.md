# first_machinelearning_model
my first machine learning model to test decision tree on student database 


**this is very basic model to test decision tree functionality**

- This model takes height and weight of students and predict BMI for result 

- This model takes both training and testing from single dataset and also single data frame  *(thats how simple this model is)*
