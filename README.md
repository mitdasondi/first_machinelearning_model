# first_machinelearning_model
my first machine learning model to test decision tree on student database 


**this is very basic model to test decision tree functionality**
***tree model***

- This model takes height and weight of students and predict BMI for result 

- This model takes both training and testing from single dataset and also single data frame  *(thats how simple this model is)* 

***train test split***

- This model will devide the data into two parts -1 trainingdata -2 testing 

- This model also count the mean absolute error(MEA) in following model to measure accuracy of it.
